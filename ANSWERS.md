#1. What is the DOM?

##DOM is short for Document Object Manipulation. It, in essense, is the integration of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create manipulable and interactive web pages. The DOM operates in such a way that when a webpage is opened it first reads the HTML for the site layout, but then overlays that layout with a JavaScript Object so that the site now has interactive elements. Similar to CSS, the DOM structure is a tree and therefore there are many inheritance, or event propagation rules, that we must follow to make sure each element on the page interacts in accordance with the stipulations we've placed on the code.
